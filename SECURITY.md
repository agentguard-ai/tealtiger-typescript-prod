# Security Policy

## 🔒 Reporting a Vulnerability

Security is our top priority. We take all security vulnerabilities seriously.

### How to Report

**Please DO NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via email to:

**Please use GitHub Security Advisories to report vulnerabilities:**

https://github.com/agentguard-ai/tealtiger/security/advisories/new

**Note**: If you get a 404 error, Security Advisories may not be enabled yet. In that case, please:
1. Open a GitHub issue with the title prefix `[SECURITY]` (do NOT include sensitive details)
2. We will contact you privately to discuss the vulnerability details

### What to Include

Please include as much of the following information as possible:

- **Type of vulnerability** (e.g., authentication bypass, injection, etc.)
- **Full paths of source file(s)** related to the vulnerability
- **Location of the affected source code** (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- **Step-by-step instructions** to reproduce the issue
- **Proof-of-concept or exploit code** (if possible)
- **Impact of the vulnerability** and how an attacker might exploit it
- **Any potential mitigations** you've identified

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 24 hours
- **Status Update**: Within 72 hours
- **Fix Timeline**: Depends on severity
  - **Critical**: 1-7 days
  - **High**: 7-14 days
  - **Medium**: 14-30 days
  - **Low**: 30-90 days

### What to Expect

1. **Acknowledgment** - We'll confirm receipt of your report
2. **Investigation** - We'll investigate and validate the vulnerability
3. **Fix Development** - We'll develop and test a fix
4. **Disclosure** - We'll coordinate disclosure with you
5. **Credit** - We'll credit you in our security advisories (if desired)

## 🛡️ Security Measures

### Current Security Features

- **API Key Authentication** - Secure authentication for all API calls
- **HTTPS Only** - All communications encrypted in transit
- **Input Validation** - Comprehensive validation of all inputs
- **Rate Limiting** - Protection against abuse
- **Audit Logging** - Complete audit trail of all actions
- **Dependency Scanning** - Regular security audits of dependencies

### Secure Development Practices

- **Code Review** - All code changes reviewed before merge
- **Automated Testing** - Comprehensive test suite including security tests
- **Dependency Updates** - Regular updates to address known vulnerabilities
- **Static Analysis** - Automated security scanning in CI/CD
- **Least Privilege** - Minimal permissions by default

## 🔐 Supported Versions

We provide security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 0.1.x   | ✅ Yes             |
| < 0.1.0 | ❌ No              |

## 🚨 Known Security Considerations

### API Key Management

**Risk**: Exposed API keys can lead to unauthorized access

**Mitigation**:
- Never commit API keys to version control
- Use environment variables for API keys
- Rotate API keys regularly
- Use different keys for different environments

```typescript
// ✅ Good - Use environment variables
const client = new TealOpenAI({
  apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY
});

// ❌ Bad - Hardcoded API key
const client = new TealOpenAI({
  apiKey: 'sk-1234567890abcdef'
});
```

### Network Security

**Risk**: Man-in-the-middle attacks on unencrypted connections

**Mitigation**:
- Always use HTTPS for SSA connections
- Validate SSL certificates
- Use certificate pinning for high-security environments

```typescript
// ✅ Good - HTTPS (OpenAI/Anthropic APIs use HTTPS by default)
const client = new TealOpenAI({
  apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY
});

// Note: TealTiger uses OpenAI/Anthropic APIs directly
// All connections are HTTPS by default
```

### Input Validation

**Risk**: Injection attacks through unvalidated inputs

**Mitigation**:
- SDK validates all inputs before sending to SSA
- Use TypeScript types for compile-time validation
- Sanitize user inputs before passing to tools

```typescript
// ✅ Good - Validated input
const result = await client.chat.completions.create({
  model: 'gpt-4',
  messages: [{ 
    role: 'user', 
    content: sanitizeInput(userInput) 
  }],
  max_tokens: Math.min(userMaxTokens, 4000)
});
```

### Dependency Security

**Risk**: Vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies

**Mitigation**:
- Regular dependency audits (`npm audit`)
- Automated dependency updates (Dependabot)
- Minimal dependency footprint
- Pinned dependency versions

## 🔍 Security Audits

### Internal Audits

- **Code Review**: Every pull request
- **Dependency Scan**: Weekly
- **Static Analysis**: On every commit
- **Penetration Testing**: Quarterly

### External Audits

We welcome security researchers to audit our code:

- **Bug Bounty**: Coming soon
- **Responsible Disclosure**: Always welcome
- **Public Audits**: Planned for v1.0.0
