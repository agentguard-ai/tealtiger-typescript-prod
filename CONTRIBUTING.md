## 🧪 Testing Guidelines

### Writing Tests

- Place tests in `__tests__` directories next to the code
- Use descriptive test names
- Test both success and failure cases
- Aim for high code coverage (>80%)

Example test structure:

```typescript
describe('TealTiger', () => {
  describe('executeTool', () => {
    it('should execute tool successfully with valid parameters', async () => {
      // Arrange
      const guard = new TealTiger(config);
      
      // Act
      const result = await guard.executeTool('test-tool', params);
      
      // Assert
      expect(result.success).toBe(true);
      expect(result.data).toBeDefined();
    });

    it('should throw error when API key is invalid', async () => {
      // Arrange
      const guard = new TealTiger({ ...config, apiKey: 'invalid' });
      
      // Act & Assert
      await expect(
        guard.executeTool('test-tool', params)
      ).rejects.toThrow('Invalid API key');
    });
  });
});
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run specific test file
npm test -- TealTiger.test.ts

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage
```

## 📚 Documentation Guidelines

### Code Documentation

- Add JSDoc comments for all public APIs
- Include parameter descriptions and return types
- Provide usage examples

```typescript
/**
 * Execute a tool with security evaluation
 * 
 * @param toolName - Name of the tool to execute
 * @param parameters - Tool parameters
 * @param context - Execution context (sessionId, userId, etc.)
 * @param executor - Optional custom executor function
 * @returns Promise resolving to execution result
 * 
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const result = await guard.executeTool(
 *   'web-search',
 *   { query: 'AI security' },
 *   { sessionId: 'session-123' }
 * );
 * ```
 */
async executeTool(
  toolName: string,
  parameters: Record<string, any>,
  context: ExecutionContext,
  executor?: ToolExecutor
): Promise<ExecutionResult>
```

### README Updates

- Keep examples up-to-date
- Add new features to the feature list
- Update API reference for new methods

## 🎨 Code Style Guidelines

### TypeScript

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Define interfaces for all public APIs
- Avoid `any` types when possible
- Use meaningful variable names

### Formatting

We use Prettier for code formatting:

```bash
npm run format
```

### Linting

We use ESLint for code quality:

```bash
npm run lint
npm run lint:fix
```
